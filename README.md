This repository contains a [copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/)
template for setting up a new repository for a Python package. Along
with a structured directory layout, this template includes
configurations for tools that improve developer experience, continuous
integration and delivery workflows, and supporting files for building
robust Python packages.

Check out our
[website](https://template-python-package.seedcase-project.org/) for
more information, such as the features it provides and a
[guide](https://template-python-package.seedcase-project.org/docs/guide/)
to using the template. For a list of changes, see our
[changelog](https://template-python-package.seedcase-project.org/docs/releases/)
